    "description": "Food waste is not just a personal loss but a global environmental crisis. When food is thrown away, all the resources used to produce it such as water, energy, and labor are wasted as well. Moreover, decomposing food in landfills releases methane, a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide. Reducing food waste can significantly decrease your carbon footprint and help combat climate change.",
